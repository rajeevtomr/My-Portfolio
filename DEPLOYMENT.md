# ðŸš€ Portfolio Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your portfolio website to GitHub Pages for free hosting.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository: `portfolio` or `my-portfolio`
5. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section (in the left sidebar)
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch
6. Select "/ (root)" folder
7. Click "Save"

## Step 4: Wait for Deployment
